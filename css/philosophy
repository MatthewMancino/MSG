The power of compounding interest is unparalleled in reaching your financial and investment goals.
Take the following example: You are a starry-eyed, fresh faced teenager with your whole life ahead of you.
And your great aunt Gertrude decided to kick the bucket, and left you a nice little inheritance of $50,000.
You being the blissfully ignorant teenager full of hormones and rage, listened to your financial advisor and put the money into a couple different diversified investments.
Let's also make the premise that your investment profile averages an 8% return, which is slightly above average.
  If you went on and lived your life, completely forgetting about Aunt Gertrude's 'little' gift, and then checked back on it
  when you were an 80 year old man. With 65 years to grow, partially in the ownership of the American economy, your
  investment would grow to the massive sum of 13.5 million dollars, just due to the awe-inspiring growth of the economy
