style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How to
Hack the ‘Cultural Mindset’ and Get Lucky Like Forrest Gump</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Forrest
Gump: the 1995 comedy/drama strikes a chord in our hearts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Despite
his mental handicap, Forrest Gump seemed to have the entire world in his
favor.&nbsp; He became a star running back, war hero, ping-pong world champion,
successful entrepreneur, and running icon. He was just in the right place at
the right time, or so they say. He is the world’s luckiest man! Although the
film was obviously fiction, are there lessons that can be learned by Gump’s
character and actions? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Luck
in Action</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Throughout
the film, we notice that Gump does things a bit differently from others. He
walks funny, he talks funny, he gets made fun of by all the bullies at school.
But he doesn’t pay much attention to all of them, mostThose situations you and
I find awkward, he gets himself in these s because he doesn’t have the
emotional intelligence to notice he’s doing anything strange or extreme.&nbsp;
He unknowingly make a difference to push along the boundaries of what’s
socially acceptable and each time it works in his favor.&nbsp; For instance, he
gains his position as a running back by running through the football field in
the middle of a big game.&nbsp; In Vietnam, he saves almost everyone in his
platoon while on a relentless search for his friend Bubba.&nbsp; When he
returns from Vietnam, he starts a Shrimp business and works beyond the comfort
level of a normal person to grow a huge, world-renown success.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gump
acts beyond the average person’s ‘cultural mindset’, or unspoken cultural norms
and rules, that govern most individuals, and pulls out ahead almost every time.&nbsp;
He takes the risks most people are too uncomfortable to take.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Deconstructing
Culture and the Cultural Mindset</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Although
most of us don’t possess Gump’s ignorance of social norms, we can all learn how
to take more risks in our lives to get lucky like he did in the movie.&nbsp;
This involves deconstructing the dynamic behind culture and cultural norms, and
learning how to ‘game the cultural system’ to come out ahead.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gaming
the cultural system is about learning those things that are technically
acceptable within the laws of our culture, but are deemed social strange or
‘too extreme’ by most people (not like cheating or scamming others out of their
money!).&nbsp; Think running across the United States until TV cameras begin
following you. It’s legal, but are you willing to do it tomorrow?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>First,
let’s examine culture.&nbsp; Culture is a dynamic set of beliefs, laws, and
customs that govern a given civilization.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cultural dynamic
decides what is acceptable to do and what isn’t.&nbsp; It shapes your actions,
words, and thoughts.&nbsp; It’s the very mold through which your perspective of
reality is shaped. Most of all, it governs a civilizations base-comfort-threshold
for what risks are acceptable to take.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
cultural mindset is how we will – for the purpose of this article – group
cultural norms, which are unspoken rules for what is acceptable and what isn’t,
and the threshold that governs society.&nbsp; Cultural norms are those
expectations and standards that are reinforced by parents, teachers, and
friends.&nbsp; Norms can be beneficial, like not burping at the dinner table or
farting in public – these things are gross and rightly unacceptable, or
restrictive, like not trying too hard at school to ‘fit in’ with your peers, or
not starting your own business because you don’t have an MBA.&nbsp; These are
arbitrary limitations and restrictions that limit your potential.&nbsp; Imagine
if Steve Jobs adhered to the latter belief, he didn’t even have a college
degree!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Crossing
the Cultural Threshold to Get Lucky Like Forrest Gump</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, it was thought that doing hill workouts as a
runner would cause heart complications, including heart failure and heart
attacks.&nbsp; It was also thought that the first man to break four minutes for
the mile would be a dead man.&nbsp; Fortunately, Roger Bannister lived to
celebrate his feat, and many ambitious runners, ignoring conventional wisdom,
worked out on the hills and lived to achieve much more success than their more
sensitive competitors. This threshold that governs a group or society can be
thought of as the line-in-the-sand that people ‘probably shouldn’t
cross’.&nbsp; These are a sum-total of restrictive norms that aren’t illegal,
but are looked down upon by society because there is a perceived harm involved
in crossing the boundary.&nbsp; These restrictive norms are often superstitions
that can’t be verified or proved wrong until someone crosses the line.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
you step outside of the cultural mindset and do those things that most people
find uncomfortable doing, you begin to ‘get lucky’ and achieve more success.&nbsp;
More than anything else, you discover that most people’s superstitions are
delusions, and that there’s a whole new world “behind the curtains” so to
say.&nbsp; This is what gaming the cultural system is.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gaming
the Cultural System</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
a video game, there is simply winning a game for completion and there’s
learning the ins and outs of a video game until you reach a mastery level that
most people don’t achieve.&nbsp; People that achieve mastery are those who are
the best at thinking ‘outside the box’ and devising tricks and shortcuts to win
levels and gain points.&nbsp; They’re also willing to work harder than anyone
else.&nbsp; Most people wouldn’t think to devise these tricks and shortcuts
themselves because to do so, they’d need to go beyond what the video game asks
of them.&nbsp; They’d need to think and act in a radically different way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is how the most successful people you know act.&nbsp; They act radically.&nbsp;
They don’t adhere to restrictive cultural norms and push the boundaries of what
is thought to be impossible.&nbsp; These people live on the edge of human
potential and push the cultural threshold.&nbsp; To become someone like this,
you must be willing to run hill workouts or run across the USA if that’s what
success calls for you.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>You
Make Your Own Luck</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
you pay attention to Forrest Gump, it isn’t that the universe bestowed success
upon him randomly throughout his life, he was just the master of exploiting
opportunities and latent talents.&nbsp; When he found himself in the right
place, he always made sure it was the right time by working hard and taking
action.&nbsp; When one of the soldiers handed him a ping-pong paddle, he
practiced until became a master.&nbsp; You, being a unique individual,
similarly possess some latent talents and likely have tons of unknown opportunities
at your disposal.&nbsp; When examining these opportunities and talents, and
finding out how to exploit them, you simple must think outside of the cultural
mindset.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
example, if you are, like me, halfway decent at writing, your run across the
USA may involve copying your favorite novel, word for word, until you have
mastered the authors writing style (it sucks but it’s totally worth it), and
crossing the cultural threshold would be simply starting a website or blog, or
sending messages to the editors of well-known magazines without any experience
or an English degree.&nbsp; If you run, it’s training relentlessly for that
race you’ve always wanted to complete.&nbsp; And if you’re a bodybuilder, it’s
maybe going against the grain and doing drop sets every week CJ Fletcher style.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
my own reading and analysis of the most successful entrepreneurs, elite
athletes, and authors, luck comes after crossing arbitrary boundaries, exploiting
hidden talents, hard work, and seizing every opportunity that comes your
way.&nbsp; If you’re not willing to do all of this, you could always hope to
win the lottery, and even then, you’ve still gotta buy the tickets.&nbsp; </span></p>
