<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Biography:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Let me start with a little blurb
about myself. My name is Matthew; but you can call me Matt or Matteo. I was
born and raised in the Pittsburgh area, but the things I am passionate about
transcend geographic location. I love human development in all areas; whether
that means psychological, emotional, or physical growth. I consider myself a
conduit of passion and enthusiasm so that other people can learn, grow, and get
better at whatever they choose to do because of me. That is my goal: to help people
find their purpose, improve their life circumstances, and get the things that
they want.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>For the past 3 and a half years
I�ve been on a search essentially, a search that expanded myself and my
horizons, but I also set out to discover more about myself. Mostly I�ve been an
introverted person, but I forced myself way out of my comfort zone. I tried
talking to more and more people and become more socially oriented. I used to be
very shy and introverted in high-school, and yet as someone about to finish their
senior year in my undergrad education, I cannot describe the mental/emotional
transformation that I, as sure as many others have gone through once trying out
new things. Myself, along with many others, have undergone a personal
transformation of self-esteem, character, and personality that really can
define who you are as a person, friend, worker, and lover.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
picked up my first book, <i>How to be a 3% Man</i> by Coach Corey Wayne,
another Internet-based life coach. I was astonished that what he suggested worked
so well. Popular media like television, radio, and Internet articles influence
our beliefs, perceptions, and mindsetsshit load of other people, I was always
under the belief that I had to be an athlete, jacked, make a ton of money, in
order for women to talk to me. I was astounded when I first tried to talk to
women, that I actually got a response! Even though I didn�t consider myself
essentially that �popular, athletic, or jacked�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I like to think all of us have
something that we want to accomplish in our lives; we have something that we
want to do or something that we want to learn. Whatever the definition of
�success� is, we need to have some roadmap of our way there. We want to do
great things; I don�t think it is a stretch to say that people desire nice and
pleasurable things in our lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So
what I am here to help you to do is to focus in on that exact thing that you
want to do; maybe you want to become a civil engineer and build great bridges.
Maybe you want to fulfill your dream of becoming and international pop-star?
It�s your life to live, only you can decide what is really important/worth
following for yourself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being
human, I�ve struggled with a great many of things; I struggle to figure out
what�s important, what is noble and good. But that�s not the point of this
article; the point is to really figure out what you want to do next.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
your own life, you might have a lot of things that want to accomplish; whether
you�re an engineer, artist, financial advisor, or world traveler. We all need a
plan to get there; we need a game plan to get to the places you want. Maybe you
want to make a shit-ton of money, you want to make a million dollars because
you want to be an important person in the world; well it doesn�t just fly into
your hands, unless you win the lottery, but good luck winning those odds.</p>
